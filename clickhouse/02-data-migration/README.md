## ⚠️ Emergency Migration

**If VPS A is failing/corrupted with 300GB+ data:**

1. **Read:** [EMERGENCY_MIGRATION.md](EMERGENCY_MIGRATION.md) - Strategies and procedures
2. **Follow:** [STEP_BY_STEP_GUIDE.md](STEP_BY_STEP_GUIDE.md) - Detailed execution steps
3. **Use:** `emergency-migrate.sh` script - Automated with resume capability

Emergency scenarios covered:
- ClickHouse server won't start
- Server instability during migration  
- Large dataset (300GB+) migration
- Resume capability for failed transfers
- Data integrity verification

Quick commands:
```bash
# Assess the situation (classifies all objects by type)
sudo ./scripts/emergency-migrate.sh assess

# Export all objects with resume capability (tables, views, MVs, dicts, users)
sudo ./scripts/emergency-migrate.sh export-all --host vps-b.example.com

# Import on VPS B (run this ON VPS B — creates schemas + imports data)
sudo ./scripts/emergency-migrate.sh import

# Or direct file copy if ClickHouse won't start
sudo ./scripts/emergency-migrate.sh copy-files --host vps-b.example.com

# Verify migration
sudo ./scripts/emergency-migrate.sh verify --host vps-b.example.com
```

## Overview

This directory contains tools and scripts for:
- **Backup VPS A**: Export data from source ClickHouse server
- **Restore to VPS B**: Import data to destination ClickHouse server
- **Real-time Migration**: Set up continuous replication between servers
- **Emergency Migration**: Handle failing servers with large datasets (300GB+)

## Prerequisites

Before starting migration:
1. Both VPS instances have ClickHouse installed with TLS (see [quickstart](../quickstart/README.md))
2. Network connectivity between VPS A and VPS B on secure ports (9440, 8443)
3. Sufficient disk space for backups
4. Same ClickHouse version on both servers (recommended)
5. TLS certificates configured and valid on both servers

## Migration Strategies

### Strategy 1: Native Backup & Restore (Recommended for ClickHouse 22.8+)

Best for: Very safe, consistent offline migration with minimal manual scripting.

1. Stop writes to VPS A
2. Run `BACKUP TABLE` or `BACKUP DATABASE` to local disk or S3
3. Transfer backup directory to VPS B
4. Run `RESTORE TABLE` or `RESTORE DATABASE` on VPS B
5. Update application connections
6. Resume writes on VPS B

### Strategy 2: Offline Migration via Native Format Export (Downtime Required)

Best for: Small datasets (< 100GB), acceptable downtime, older ClickHouse versions.

1. Stop writes to VPS A
2. Backup all data from VPS A using `FORMAT Native`
3. Transfer to VPS B
4. Restore on VPS B using `FORMAT Native`
5. Update application connections
6. Resume writes on VPS B

### Strategy 3: Online Migration (Minimal Downtime)

Best for: Large datasets, minimal downtime requirement

1. Set up real-time replication
2. Sync historical data
3. Switch to dual-write mode
4. Verify data consistency
5. Switch application to VPS B
6. Stop replication

### Strategy 4: Parallel Run (Zero Downtime)

Best for: Critical production systems

1. Set up replication from VPS A to VPS B
2. Run both systems in parallel
3. Gradually shift read traffic to VPS B
4. Switch write traffic to VPS B
5. Decommission VPS A

## Quick Start

### Backup from VPS A

```bash
# On VPS A
ssh user@vps-a
cd /path/to/clickhouse-test/02-data-migration/scripts
sudo ./backup-vps-a.sh
```

### Restore to VPS B

```bash
# On VPS B
ssh user@vps-b
cd /path/to/clickhouse-test/02-data-migration/scripts
sudo ./restore-vps-b.sh --source vps-a.example.com --backup-path /backup/clickhouse/
```

### Setup Real-time Replication

```bash
# On VPS B
sudo ./migrate-realtime.sh --source vps-a.example.com --mode setup
```

```

## Configuration

### Network Requirements

Ensure these ports are open between VPS A and VPS B:
- Port 9440 (native protocol with TLS) - **Required**
- Port 8443 (HTTPS with TLS) - **Required**

**Note:** Non-secure ports (9000, 8123) should be disabled or firewalled in production.

### TLS Prerequisites

Both servers must have:
1. Valid TLS certificates configured
2. Secure ports enabled (9440, 8443)
3. CA certificates available for verification

### User Permissions

Create a dedicated migration user on both servers:

```sql
-- On VPS A (source - only needs SELECT)
CREATE USER migration_user IDENTIFIED WITH sha256_password BY 'secure_password';
GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO migration_user;

-- On VPS B (destination - needs INSERT and DDL)
CREATE USER migration_user IDENTIFIED WITH sha256_password BY 'secure_password';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, CREATE, ALTER, DROP ON *.* TO migration_user;
```

## Backup Process

### What Gets Backed Up

1. **Database schemas** (CREATE TABLE statements)
2. **Table data** (exported as Native format or via `BACKUP` command)
3. **User definitions** (users, roles, quotas)
4. **Configuration files** (optional)
5. **Metadata** (partitions, mutations)

### Backup Formats

- **Native**: Binary format. This is the **Absolute Requirement** for fast ClickHouse-to-ClickHouse migrations.
- **Parquet**: Columnar format, good for analytics.
- **TSV**: Text format, human-readable. *WARNING: Do not use TSV for large migrations (>10GB) due to high CPU/Memory overhead and slow performance.*

### Backup Storage

Backups are stored in:
```
/backup/clickhouse/
├── schemas/           # Database and table schemas
├── data/              # Table data
├── users/             # User definitions
└── metadata/          # System metadata
```

## Restore Process

### Prerequisites Check

The restore script verifies:
1. ClickHouse is running on VPS B
2. Sufficient disk space available
3. No naming conflicts
4. Compatible ClickHouse versions

### Restore Steps

1. **Pre-restore validation**
   - Check disk space
   - Verify ClickHouse status
   - Validate backup integrity

2. **Schema restoration**
   - Create databases
   - Create tables with proper engine settings
   - Set up materialized views

3. **Data restoration**
   - Import data in optimal batch sizes
   - Verify row counts
   - Check data integrity

4. **Post-restore validation**
   - Compare row counts with source
   - Run sample queries
   - Verify permissions

## Real-time Migration

                    │  └───────────────────────────────┘  │
                    └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Replication Setup

1. **Configure remote_servers.xml** on both VPS
2. **Create distributed tables** for cross-cluster queries
3. **Set up ReplicatedMergeTree** tables
4. **Initialize replication** with existing data
5. **Monitor replication lag**

### Monitoring

Track replication health:

```sql
-- Check replication status
SELECT *
FROM system.replication_queue
WHERE is_currently_executing = 1;

-- Check replication lag
SELECT 
    database,
    table,
    is_leader,
    total_replicas,
    active_replicas,
    zookeeper_path
FROM system.replicas;

-- Check parts to fetch
SELECT 
    database,
    table,
    type,
    count()
FROM system.replication_queue
GROUP BY database, table, type;
```

## Performance Considerations

### Backup Performance

- Use multi-threading for large tables
- Compress backups to reduce I/O
- Schedule backups during low-traffic hours
- Monitor disk I/O during backup

### Restore Performance

- Restore largest tables first
- Use max_insert_threads for parallel inserts
- Disable replication during initial load
- Consider materialized view recreation

### Network Transfer

- Use compression for network transfer
- Consider rsync for incremental transfers
- Use dedicated network link if available
- Monitor bandwidth usage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Backup Failures:**
```bash
# Check disk space
df -h /backup/

# Check ClickHouse logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/clickhouse-server/clickhouse-server.log

# Verify permissions
ls -la /backup/clickhouse/
```

**Restore Failures:**
```bash
# Check if tables already exist
clickhouse-client -q "SHOW TABLES FROM database_name"

# Check for schema conflicts
clickhouse-client -q "SELECT name, engine FROM system.tables WHERE database = 'database_name'"

# Verify backup integrity
tar -tzf backup_file.tar.gz | head
```

**Replication Issues:**
```bash
# Check ZooKeeper connection
clickhouse-client -q "SELECT * FROM system.zookeeper WHERE path = '/'"

# Check replica status
clickhouse-client -q "SELECT * FROM system.replicas FORMAT Vertical"

# Check for errors
clickhouse-client -q "SELECT * FROM system.replication_queue WHERE last_exception != '' FORMAT Vertical"
```

## Security

### Data Protection

1. **Encrypt backups** at rest
2. **Use TLS** for data transfer
3. **Secure backup storage** with restricted access
4. **Audit migration** activities

### Access Control

1. Use dedicated migration user with limited privileges
2. Enable SSL/TLS for all connections
3. Restrict network access to migration ports
4. Log all migration activities

## Best Practices

1. **Test migration** on non-production data first
2. **Document** all custom configurations
3. **Monitor** resource usage during migration
4. **Validate** data integrity after migration
5. **Keep backups** until migration is verified
6. **Have rollback plan** ready

## Next Steps

After successful migration:
1. Update application connection strings
2. Configure monitoring for new server
3. Set up regular backups on VPS B
4. Decommission VPS A (if no longer needed)
5. Document any lessons learned
